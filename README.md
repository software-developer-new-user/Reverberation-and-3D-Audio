# Reverberation-and-3D-Audio

1: Revervation

I did the to implement Schroeder reverberation. Audio example is in Schroeder reverberation folder.

I also applied a real room response to the original sound. The example of this is in real room response folder.

2: 3D Audio
Implemented code of HRTFs to convert ordinary audio to 3D audio coming from certain direction. An example of this is in 3D Audio folder.
